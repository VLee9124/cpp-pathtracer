# cpp-pathtracer

This is my code-along to Raytracing In One Weekend to learn more about raytracing and review C++.

Notes + Todo List:

*   Features Multithreaded renderer using C++ Threads
    - Multithreaded version using C++ threads on [main branch](https://github.com/VLee9124/cpp-pathtracer/tree/main)
    - Multithreaded version using OpenMP on [openmp branch](https://github.com/VLee9124/cpp-pathtracer/tree/openmp)
*   Code needs to be refactored

Here is a sample render that took 30 minutes to render.
